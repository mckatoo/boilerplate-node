# Boilerplate node with typescript

## This is a boilerplate for work using node with typescript without forget tests and transpiler.
It aims to speed up the start of an application using node and typescript in the backend.
To use with frontend you must update tsconfig.json in properties like `lib=["ES6", "DOM"]` among others.

## Test: Jest
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
Works great using Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue, and more!

## Transpiler: Babel
Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.
